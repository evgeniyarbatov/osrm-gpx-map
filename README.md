# OSM Maps from GPX

Create OSM maps from GPX files to use with OSRM.

## Overview

- Sample GPX files. Ex. use turn points only
- Snap points to grid with OSRM on the entire map. Get node IDs
- Create ways from GPX files: one GPX file - one way (?)
- Build OSM XML and use with OSRM
- Check that routing is working as expected with custom OSM
